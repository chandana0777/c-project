## **X'S AND O'S  GAME**

It is a simple, two-player game that, if played optimally by both players, will always result in a tie. The game is also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. It is a game that is traditionally played by being drawn on paper, and it can be played on a computer or on a variety of media.
